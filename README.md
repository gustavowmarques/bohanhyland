# Bohan & Hyland's Website Project


## Project Concept

The idea for this project came from my partner, he works in a property management company called **Bohan & Hyland** and this is their current website: https://bohanhyland.ie/

He informed that their website have not been updated for some years and it could be improved to compete with modern competitor's websites (e.g. [https://www.sherryfitz.ie/](https://www.sherryfitz.ie/)). Their website could include features that would benefite **The Block and Facilities Management** team within the department that he works. Examples of these features would be:
  
  - A map showing power outages in the area;
  - A page where their members would be able to order keys, fobs keys and zappers;

These features would be beneficial as at the moment those order are made by email and they get several daily emails, if the order is not clearly specified in the email subject, the email most likely will endup being lost among hundreds of other emails and this would cause big delays. The order page section on the website would help them to better manage those orders.

These were the minimum requirements proposed:
  - A more mordern looking website than their current one;
  - A request to remove the whitebox around their logo;
  - To include a "Member's Portal" section were only registered users would have access. After successful login, the member would have access to:
    - Orders page
    - Request MUD Reports
    - Login an issue
    - access to their services charges account (myblockman account)
  - A lettings page showing the available properties for letting;
  - A Residential Sales page, showing the available properties for sale; 


### Plan of Project's Structure
After hearing the ideas, my first step was to create the html pages that I knew we would need and start from them. More pages to be added later if necessary. 

These are the pages:
  - Home Page (index.html)
  - About Us (about-us.html)
  - Members Portal  (members-portal)
    - Register Page (register.html)
    - Login Page (login.html)
    - Order Portal (order.html)
  - Contact Us (contact.html)
  - Services
    - Residential Sales
    - Lettings

## Key Features

### 1. Semantic HTML Structure
- **Multi-Section Layout:** The application is divided into clearly defined sections (home, about, interactive demo, contact) using semantic tags.
- **Consistent Navigation:** A persistent navigation bar allows easy access to all sections, ensuring an intuitive user flow.

### 2. Responsive CSS Styling
- **Modern Design:** Custom typography, color schemes, and layouts create a visually appealing experience.
- **Responsive Layouts:** Media queries ensure that the project adapts gracefully to various screen sizesâ€”from mobile devices to desktops.
- **Clean Aesthetics:** Thoughtful use of margins, paddings, and background styles provides a professional look and feel.

### 3. JavaScript Interactivity
- **Interactive Form Processing:** A contact form is dynamically processed by a JavaScript function. Input validation and real-time feedback enhance user interaction.
- **DOM Manipulation:** 
  - **Content Update:** Dynamic text and image updates based on user actions.
  - **Interactive Gallery/Slider:** Users can interact with graphical elements that slide through content, demonstrating advanced DOM manipulation.
  - **Event-Driven Interactions:** Multiple elements (e.g., buttons, menus) use event listeners to trigger smooth transitions and changes within the page.
- **Enhanced User Feedback:** Real-time validations and visual cues improve the overall user experience.

### 4. Graphics and Interactive Elements
- **Graphical Integration:** An interactive image slider/gallery is incorporated, serving both as a visual focal point and as an example of advanced JavaScript usage.
- **Engagement through Interaction:** Every interactive element is designed not just for functionality but to drive engagement and showcase web development best practices.
